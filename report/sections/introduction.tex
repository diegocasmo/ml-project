\section{Introduction}


why do we study galaxies?
  -
why does it need to be automated?
  - As a consequence, astronomy is nowadays one of the main research fields in the big data context (T. Hey, S. Tansley, and K. Tolle, Eds., The Fourth Paradigm: Data- Intensive Scientific Discovery. Redmond, Washington: Microsoft Research, 2009.)
where does this data come from?
  - Our latest galaxy images come from the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS). Because it uses a larger telescope, DECaLS is 10 times more sensitive to light than the survey that supplied images to the first iteration of Galaxy Zoo, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. That means that we can see more detail. (https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zookeeper/galaxy-zoo/about/research)
why is machine/deep learning a suitable candidate solution?
