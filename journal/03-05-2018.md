# May 4, 2018

## Objectives for last week:

Data Section
- Finish up description of the problem in more detail (what is given to us and what is out goal?)
- Discuss data attributes (how many images?, training set v.s. test set, size of images, details, etc)

Methods Section
- Start working in introduction to deep learning
- Start working in introduction to CNN
- Start working in choice of architecture (VGG16)

## Accomplishments last week:
There was a lot of progress made in the methods section, but it's still unfinished. Our plan is to continuously improve the report as we go, instead of writing it all at the end. There was not enough progress in the data section though, that's something we need to improve.

## Problems and solutions:
We chose to work more independently this week, so instead of sitting all together to write each of the sections at the same time, we split the work for the methods section and wrote it independently and then review it together.

## Next week's objectives:
- Catch up with the data section (which we failed to finish this week)
- Start working on the implementation of the CNN

## Long-term plan:
Demonstrate how a convolutional neural network can be constructed to analyze images of galaxies to find automated metrics that reproduce the probability distributions derived from expert human classifications.
