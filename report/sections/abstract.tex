In 2014, Kaggle organized the Galaxy Zoo challenge to analyze images of galaxies in order to automate the tagging of morphological attributes. For a machine to automatically learn the features directly from data a deep convolutional neural network was implemented. The idea presented here is to combine star galaxy with CNN. This would be applied directly on the dimensionally reduced, calibrated pixel values, thus giving required results from reduced sets of user input. The model was trained on a dataset of \numprint{61578} images with a variety of batch sizes and input formats. One of the methods ultimately attained a Top 100 score on the Kaggle leaderboards. Further advances can be done to improve the performance of the model by tuning other hyperparameters like learning rate and number of epochs.
