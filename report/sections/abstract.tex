In 2014 Kaggle organized the Galaxy Zoo challenge to analyze images of galaxies and determine the probability of morphological attributes. To enable a machine to automatically learn the features directly from data, require the use of Deep convolutional neural networks. They are one of the latest advances in Machine Learning which has minimized the need for input from human experts.The idea presented here is to combine star galaxy with CNN. This would be applied directly on the reduced, calibrated pixel values, thus giving required results from reduced sets of user input. Training the model with a given \numprint{61578} images by tuning batch and image sizes attained a Top 100 score in the Kaggle scoreboard. Further advances can be done to improve the performance of the model by tuning other hyperparameters like learning rate and number of epochs.
