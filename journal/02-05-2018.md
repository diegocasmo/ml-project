## Questions we have for Friday

Compiled in an unexpected meeting by Ankur and Tristan

- How detailed do we have to be. e.g. We do not need to explain Perceptrons or Neural Networks, right? _The audience in this instance already knows about neural networks, no need to dive deep._

- Are there GPU's the school has which we can have time on, or are we on our own hardware-wise? _Lab rooms on 13xx have GPU's in them! Don't hog them indefinitely, but we would be allowed to stick around and use them._

- We're mostly replicating the papers we've found, to what extent do we discuss our results. They'll certainly be a little worse than those which we're (Moved to questions for next week) _Coming up with something "new" is discouraged. Maybe implement a cool twist, but this is not an academic paper, just for us to understand and explore some cool aspect._
