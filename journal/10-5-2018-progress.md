# May 10, 2018 (Progress)

## Objectives from last week:

- Catch up with the data section (success)
- Start working on the implementation of the CNN (success)

Data & Methods Section

- Proofreading and word choices
- More writing on Deep learning
- Much more writing on CNN's
- More writing on VGG-16 and choices around similar architectures

## Accomplishments last week

- We are continuously improving the data and methods sections. We're not having any issues with finding papers to support and cite what we're saying.
- Simple implementation of VGG-16 working with our training data.
- Able to run our implementation on a GPU.
- Regular meetings to stay on top of workload.

## Problems and solutions:

- Some issues with implementation but they were trudged through error by error. The unmodified VGG model has an output layer of 1000 and we've figured out how to replace it with an output layer with the size we need (37). We have our datasets split up from a few weeks ago and we can begin training it soon.

## Next week's objectives:

- Flesh out and refine data and methods section. Particularly in methods, the CNN subsection needs more eyes and work.
- Get a fully trained version of our CNN, get some initial results.

## Long-term plan:
Demonstrate how a convolutional neural network can be constructed to analyze images of galaxies to find automated metrics that reproduce the probability distributions derived from expert human classifications.
