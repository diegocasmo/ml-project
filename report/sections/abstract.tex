In 2014 Kaggle organized the Galaxy Zoo challenge to analyze images of galaxies and determine the probability of morphological attributes. A deep convolutional neural network was used for this image recognition problem as it learns to recognize components of images and to combine them to recognize larger structures. Training the model with a given \numprint{61578} images by tuning batch and image sizes attained a Top 100 score in the Kaggle scoreboard. Further advances can be done to improve the performance of the model by tuning other hyperparameters like learning rate and number of epochs.
