%How did you solve it?
In 2014 Kaggle organized galaxy zoo challenge to analyze a galaxy image and find the probability that it belongs in a particular class. Classification for training images into 37 different was done by humans in a crowd sourced volunteer effort. Deep convolutional neural network comes to the rescue for this image recognition problem as it learns to recognize components of an image and to combine these components to recognize larger structures in an image. Our choice of architecture for CNN model was VGG-16.
