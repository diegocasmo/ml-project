# May 25, 2018 (Progress)

## Objectives from last week:

- Obtain better results (success!)
- Write implementation and results sections (good progress)

## Accomplishments last week

- Generate interesting results.
- Flesh out certain sections more.
- Work on the implementation and results section of the report.
- Better explanation of what each of the 37 categories of the galaxies actually mean (what the network is supposed to learn).

## Problems and solutions:

- We feel that we need to write more and the document is a little sparse.
- We solved the issue we had with the network not producing good results.

## Next week's objectives:

- Finish report.
- Implement feedback from final meeting.

## Long-term plan:
Demonstrate how a convolutional neural network can be constructed to analyze images of galaxies to find automated metrics that reproduce the probability distributions derived from volunteer human classifications.
