# Papers and Kernels

## Papers
- [Convolutional Neural Networks for Toxic Comment Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.09957v1.pdf)
This talks about the exact Kaggle competition we're primarily looking at. (Usefullness 5/5)
- [Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentiment Analysis of Short Texts](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/C14-1008)
Classifies stance again like the previous paper however just with text content of tweets, which is closer to the length to the comments in our dataset. Looks at stance again like the previous paper. (Usefullness 4/5)
- [A Deep Learning Model of Stance Classification on Social Media Text](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.03599v1.pdf)
Using a "UTCNN" they classify _stance_ of users given not only comments and statuses but also likes and other activity on a social network.
