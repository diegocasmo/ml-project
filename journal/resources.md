## Papers and Publications

- [My Solution to the Galaxy Zoo](http://benanne.github.io/2014/04/05/galaxy-zoo.html)
Great examples of preprocessing and a successful network architecture. Corresponding repository below.

- [Machine learning and image analysis for morphological galaxy classification](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/349/1/87/3101624)
> In this paper we present an experimental study of machine learning and image analysis for performing automated morphological galaxy classification. We used a neural network, and a locally weighted regression method, and implemented homogeneous ensembles of classifiers.

- [Galaxy Zoo: Reproducing Galaxy Morphologies Via Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/0908.2033)

### VGG-16
- [Transfer learning using VGG-16 model](https://medium.com/@asheesh12feb/transfer-learning-using-vgg-16-model-2f9b5944b8b2) Medium has such a wealth of software/ml tutorials it's criminal. Just try a search for "Getting started with *X*" to start learning something.

- [Using VGG-16 (and other pretrained models) in Keras](https://www.learnopencv.com/keras-tutorial-using-pre-trained-imagenet-models/) There are some nice code samples here.

- [An Automatic Diagnosis Method of Facial Acne Vulgaris Based on Convolutional Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04481) A citation for data-augmentation should we need another.

## Kernels / Repositories

- [Repository for the winning Galaxy submission](https://github.com/benanne/kaggle-galaxies)
Corresponding blog post above.

## Other resources

- [Deep Learning with Keras + TensorFlow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3oMKS1AfVI&list=PLX-LrBk6h3wR27xylD3Rsx4bbA15jlcYC): this is a nice and simple playlist on how to use keras CNNs

 - [Splitting of data in test and validation ratio](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228911350_Data_Division_for_Developing_Neural_Networks_Applied_to_Geotechnical_Engineering)
