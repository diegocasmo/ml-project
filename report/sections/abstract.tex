In 2014 Kaggle organized galaxy zoo challenge to analyze a galaxy image and find the probability that it belongs to a particular class. Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was used for this image recognition problem as it learns to recognize components of an image and to combine them to recognize larger structures in an image. Training our model with given \numprint{61578} images by tuning batch and image sizes got us into Top 100 in the  Kaggle scoreboard. Further advances can be done to improve the performance of the model by tuning other hyperparameters like learning rate and no of epochs etc.
