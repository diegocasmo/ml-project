# May 17, 2018 (Progress)

## Objectives from last week:

- Flesh out and refine data and methods section. Particularly in methods, the CNN subsection needs more eyes and work. (partial success)
- Get a fully trained version of our CNN, get some initial results. (partially complete, getting results, but they're not very good)

## Accomplishments last week



## Problems and solutions:


## Next week's objectives:

## Long-term plan:
Demonstrate how a convolutional neural network can be constructed to analyze images of galaxies to find automated metrics that reproduce the probability distributions derived from expert human classifications.
