List of links shared in a group chat, organized here for our convenience. Append links and resources as necessary.

## Papers and Publications

- [My Solution to the Galaxy Zoo](http://benanne.github.io/2014/04/05/galaxy-zoo.html)
Great examples of preprocessing and a successful network architecture. Corresponding repository below.

- [Machine learning and image analysis for morphological galaxy classification](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/349/1/87/3101624)
> In this paper we present an experimental study of machine learning and image analysis for performing automated morphological galaxy classification. We used a neural network, and a locally weighted regression method, and implemented homogeneous ensembles of classifiers.

## Kernels / Repositories

- [Repository for the winning Galaxy submission](https://github.com/benanne/kaggle-galaxies)

## Other resources

- [Deep Learning with Keras + TensorFlow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3oMKS1AfVI&list=PLX-LrBk6h3wR27xylD3Rsx4bbA15jlcYC): this is a nice and simple playlist on how to use keras CNNs
