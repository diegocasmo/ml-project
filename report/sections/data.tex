\section{The Dataset}

The "Galaxy Zoo" dataset consists of a total \numprint{141,553} images. These are split into \numprint{61578} images for training --each with their respective probability distributions for the classifications for each of the inputs-- and \numprint{79975} images for testing.

As a crowd-sourced volunteer effort, images of the dataset were classified across 37 different categories. Each of the 37 categories has a floating point number between 0 and 1 inclusive. These numbers represent the shape of a galaxy in 37 different categories as identified by the volunteers. These shapes are related to probabilities for each category; a number close to 1 indicates many users identified this category for the galaxy image with a high level of confidence, while numbers close to 0 indicate otherwise.

Due to these probabilities being tied to each image this is a regression problem rather than a classification problem. Therefore the task is to determine the fraction of people who would classify a galaxy as having particular qualities or otherwise.

\subsection{Data Preprocessing}

All images in the dataset are of size $424\times424$ and the object of interest is centered. As a result, during the pre-processing images are cropped to $212\times212$, half their original size. Additionally, images are also sub-sampled, essentially carving off unnecessary information in each image which could impair the network. Down sampling can help the CNN learn which regions are related to each specific expression as well as perform on the GPU more efficiently \cite{deep-learning-review}.
