In 2014 Kaggle organized the Galaxy Zoo challenge to analyze images of galaxies and determine the probability of morphological attributes. To enable a machine to automatically learn the features directly from data, require the use of Deep convolutional neural networks. They are one of the latest advances in Machine Learning which has minimized the need for input from human experts.The idea presented here is to combine star galaxy with CNN. This would be applied directly on the reduced, calibrated pixel values, thus giving required results from reduced sets of user input. The model was trained on a dataset of \numprint{61578} images with a variety of batch sizes and input formats. One of the methods ultimately attained a Top 100 score on the Kaggle leaderboards. Further advances can be done to improve the performance of the model by tuning other hyperparameters like learning rate and number of epochs.
