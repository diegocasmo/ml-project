- Drafting introduction
- Compiling more sources
- Learning about the dataset. The Galaxy images are from the Sloan Digital sky survey (which phase?). Ongoing since 1998, the Sloan Digital Sky survey (SDSS)project works on capturing the night sky for research purposes. There is a page [on citing SDSS](http://www.sdss.org/collaboration/citing-sdss/), it's a bit unclear which one we should cite and what data they actually provide.
- Drafting the data section and learning about methods used in other papers.
- Diego setup a data pipeline for the data in a jupyter notebook which included the training and validation datasets.
