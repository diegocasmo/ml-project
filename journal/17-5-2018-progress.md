# May 17, 2018 (Progress)

## Objectives from last week:

- Flesh out and refine data and methods section. Particularly in methods, the CNN subsection needs more eyes and work. (partial success)
- Get a fully trained version of our CNN, get some initial results. (partially complete, getting results, but they're not very good)

## Accomplishments last week

- Review and merge neural networks and deep learning sections
- Avoid using 'we' in the report 
- Include table with a description of each of the layers in the VGG-16 architecture 
- Improve the order of the sections in the report

## Problems and solutions:

- We are having issues with the results obtained by our network (poor). It seems like we are not correctly formatting the input for the network. This is our priority #1, as the next sections of the report (implementation and results) depend on it.

## Next week's objectives:

- Obtain better results
- Start writing implementation and results sections

## Long-term plan:
Demonstrate how a convolutional neural network can be constructed to analyze images of galaxies to find automated metrics that reproduce the probability distributions derived from expert human classifications.
